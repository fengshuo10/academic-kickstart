I am a post-doctoral research fellow at the [Michigan Traffic Lab](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/) of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with [Prof. Henry X. Liu](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/). 
I received the bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Automation at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), China, in 2014 and 2019, respectively, advised by Prof. Yi Zhang. 
I was also a visiting Ph.D. student in Civil and Environmental Engineering with University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, from 2017 to 2019, advised by Prof. Henry X. Liu.	
I received the [Best Ph.D. Dissertation Award](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/stories/shuo-feng-wins-second-prize-for-ieee-intelligent-transportation-systems-societys-best-phd-dissertation-award/) from the [IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS)](https://www.ieee-itss.org/awards-best-dissertation) in 2020. 
My current research interests include testing, evaluation, and optimization of connected and automated vehicles.
