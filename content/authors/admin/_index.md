I am currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the department of Automation at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I was an Assistant Research Scientist at [University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI)](https://umtri.umich.edu/). Before joining UMTRI, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [Michigan Traffic Lab](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/) of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with [Prof. Henry X. Liu](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/). 
I received the bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Automation at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), China, in 2014 and 2019, respectively, where I was advised by [Prof. Yi Zhang](http://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1084/1701.htm). 
I was also a visiting Ph.D. student in Civil and Environmental Engineering with the University of Michigan from 2017 to 2019, where I was advised by [Prof. Henry X. Liu](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/).

I received the [Best Ph.D. Dissertation Award](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/stories/shuo-feng-wins-second-prize-for-ieee-intelligent-transportation-systems-societys-best-phd-dissertation-award/) from the [IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS)](https://ieee-itss.org/awards/best-dissertation/) in 2020 and the [Intelligent Transportation Systems Outstanding Paper Award](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Community-Prizes/Transportation-Science-and-Logistics-Section/SIG-Outstanding-Paper-in-Intelligent-Transportation-Systems) from the [INFORMS Transportation Science and Logistics society](https://connect.informs.org/tsl/home) in 2021. 
I am serving various roles in multiple academic organizations, including Member in the [SAE On-Road Automated Driving (ORAD) Verification and Validation Task Force](https://www.sae.org/works/committeeHome.do?comtID=TEVAVS4#), Organizer of the IEEE 2021 Intelligent Vehicles Symposium ["Cooperative Driving in Mixed Traffic" Workshop](https://ziranw.github.io/iv2021workshop/),
Organizer of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning ["A Blessing in Disguise: The Prospects and Perils of Adversarial Machine Learning" Workshop](https://advml-workshop.github.io/icml2021/), and Organizer of the IEEE-ITSC 2022 workshop ["Safety Validation of Connected and Automated Vehicles"](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/ieee-itsc-2022-safety/home). I have also served as Associated Editor of [IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7274857), Academic Editor of [Automotive Innovation](https://www.springer.com/journal/42154), Guest Editor of [SAE International Journal of Electrified Vehicles](https://www.sae.org/publications/journals/calls-for-papers-electrified-vehicles/special-issue-eco-driving), 
and Special Issue Editorial Board of [Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering/about/call-for-papers#safety-for-intelligent-and-connected-vehicles).

My current research interests lie in developing and validating safety-critical machine learning, particularly for [connected and automated vehicle testing and evaluation](https://traffic.engin.umich.edu/research/automated-vehicle-system-testing-and-evaluation).
On these topics, I have published around 30 articles on refereed journals, including [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/), [IEEE Trans. Intell. Transp. Syst.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6979), [IEEE Trans. Control Syst. Technol.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=87), and [Transp. Res. Part C Emerg. Technol.](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/transportation-research-part-c-emerging-technologies).
